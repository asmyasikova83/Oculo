lists of participants:

autism_all.txt
normals_all.txt 

plot_RT_raw.R - script for preprocessing and plotting raw response time over 
                choice types and groups (normals, autists) options for splitting
                into feedback prev.

plot_RT_raw_by_choice.R - same as plot_RT_raw.R with LMM statistics

plot_RT_Z_ANOVA.R - script for preprocessing and plotting Z-transformed 
                response time with ANOVA and 2 choice types (risk, postrisk)
                analysis od normality of distributions is included.

LMEM_oculo_graph_group_by_choice.R - script for preprocessing and plotting Z-transformed
                pupillometric data. Feedback cur in the model can be replaced with
                feedback prev.

LMEM_oculo_traits.R - correlations between traits of character and pupil Z

plot_pupil_timecourse_kseniya_averaging_btw_group.py - timecourses and t-statistics betw 
               normals and autists

plot_pupil_timecourse_kseniya_averaging_in_group.py - timecourses and t-statistics betw
               in group
